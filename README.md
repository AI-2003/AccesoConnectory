# accesoConnectory

Automated access servers for Connectory.

This repository contains two main directories:
- **servidor-preregistro**: This service enables users to complete their preregistration from their personal devices.
- **servidor-acceso**: This service is designed for on-site personnel to manage access.

The login functionality is fully implemented in the access server. While user account creation for administrators is not yet included, the existing login system is robust and functional.

Please note that captcha integration for the preregistration server is currently under development.
